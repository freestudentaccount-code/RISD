Prompt: Create an Emoji Invaders arcade game similar to Space Invaders with ship, aliens, levels, timer, and high score.
Reasoning: Added a minimal playable HTML5 canvas game that meets the requirements: ship movement, shooting, alien rows that increase each level, time limit per level which decreases, aliens speed up as time runs out, and high score persistence. Used emoji for aliens to keep it fun.
Changed: Added `index.html`, `style.css`, `main.js`, `README.md`.
Modified Files: (new) index.html, style.css, main.js, README.md
GitHub Commit Summary: Initial add - Emoji Invaders game (HTML/CSS/JS)

Prompt: Improve emoji visibility in dark mode
Reasoning: Emoji were hard to see against the dark canvas; added a soft rounded background, larger emoji font, and subtle glow to increase contrast.
Changed: Updated `main.js` to render a rounded background behind each alive alien emoji, increase emoji font size, and add glow. Added `roundRect` helper.
Modified Files: main.js
GitHub Commit Summary: Improve emoji visibility (background + glow)

Prompt: Prevent alien rows from overflowing to bottom
Reasoning: On higher levels adding rows could push aliens too close to the ship; cap rows to the maximum that fits the canvas and show a brief message when rows are limited.
Changed: Updated `main.js` to compute maximum rows that fit and cap rows added per level. Shows a short message if rows were limited.
Modified Files: main.js
GitHub Commit Summary: Cap alien rows so they fit on-screen

2025-10-22  (jasmoone)
Prompt: Only add 1 row per level
Reasoning: Make progression predictable by adding exactly one row per level instead of multiple rows.
Changed: Updated `main.js` row calculation to use baseRows + (level-1).
Modified Files: main.js
GitHub Commit Summary: Levels now add exactly one alien row each

Prompt: Fix level jump (skipping many levels)
Reasoning: Multiple scheduled level transitions could be queued when all aliens die within a short time window, causing level to jump. Added a transitioning guard to ensure only a single level advance is scheduled.
Changed: Updated `main.js` to use a `transitioning` flag and prevent multiple scheduled initLevel calls.
Modified Files: main.js
GitHub Commit Summary: Prevent multiple level transitions (fix level jump)

2025-10-22  (jasmoone)
Prompt: Fix hanging after last alien (level transition not happening reliably)
Reasoning: Replaced the previous transitioning flag with a dedicated `levelTimeout` guard and explicitly increment the `level` before calling `initLevel(level)` so progression is sequential and won't hang.
Changed: Updated `main.js` to use `levelTimeout` and increment `level` when transitioning to the next level.
Modified Files: main.js
GitHub Commit Summary: Fix level transition hang using levelTimeout guard

Prompt: Add sounds and enforce game over when timer hits zero
Reasoning: Make shooting and game over more satisfying and ensure the level ends when time reaches zero.
Changed: Added `pew.wav` playback on shoot and `gameover.wav` on game over; enforced game over when timer reaches 0 and aliens remain.
Modified Files: main.js
GitHub Commit Summary: Add sounds and time-up game over

2025-10-22  (jasmoone)
Prompt: Play nextlevel.wav on level clear
Reasoning: Add audio feedback when player clears a level to celebrate progress.
Changed: Added `nextlevel.wav` playback on level clear in `main.js`.
Modified Files: main.js
GitHub Commit Summary: Play next level sound on level clear

2025-10-22  (jasmoone)
Prompt: Increase difficulty per level
Reasoning: Make the game more challenging by reducing level time faster and increasing alien speed scaling.
Changed: Level time now decreases by 5 seconds per level (minimum 3s). Alien base speed and end-of-timer acceleration were increased in `main.js`.
Modified Files: main.js
GitHub Commit Summary: Reduce level time by 5s and increase alien speed scaling

2025-10-22  (jasmoone)
Prompt: Prefer stronger speed-up while timer counts down instead of large per-level time cuts
Reasoning: To keep gameplay pacing consistent, reverted the aggressive -5s/level change and instead tuned alien base speed and timer-based acceleration so aliens speed up as the counter approaches zero.
Changed: Restored milder per-level time decrease and increased the timer-based alien acceleration in `main.js`.
Modified Files: main.js
GitHub Commit Summary: Tie stronger speed-up to timer (revert -5s/level)

2025-10-22  (jasmoone)
Prompt: Add High Score registration and Start New Game button
Reasoning: Allow players to save their name when they beat the high score and provide a clear Start New Game button to restart without reloading the page.
Changed: Updated `index.html` to include `Start New Game` button and a high-score input form. Updated `style.css` for layout. Updated `main.js` to persist a high-score list in localStorage and to show the form when a new high score is achieved.
Modified Files: index.html, style.css, main.js
GitHub Commit Summary: Add high-score registry and Start New Game button

2025-10-22  (jasmoone)
Prompt: Add transitioning fallback variable
Reasoning: Prevent potential ReferenceError from older cached scripts that still reference `transitioning`.
Changed: Added `let transitioning = false;` as a harmless fallback in `main.js`.
Modified Files: main.js
GitHub Commit Summary: Add transitioning fallback
