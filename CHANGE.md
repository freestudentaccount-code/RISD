Prompt: Create an Emoji Invaders arcade game similar to Space Invaders with ship, aliens, levels, timer, and high score.
Reasoning: Added a minimal playable HTML5 canvas game that meets the requirements: ship movement, shooting, alien rows that increase each level, time limit per level which decreases, aliens speed up as time runs out, and high score persistence. Used emoji for aliens to keep it fun.
Changed: Added `index.html`, `style.css`, `main.js`, `README.md`.
Modified Files: (new) index.html, style.css, main.js, README.md
GitHub Commit Summary: Initial add - Emoji Invaders game (HTML/CSS/JS)

Prompt: Improve emoji visibility in dark mode
Reasoning: Emoji were hard to see against the dark canvas; added a soft rounded background, larger emoji font, and subtle glow to increase contrast.
Changed: Updated `main.js` to render a rounded background behind each alive alien emoji, increase emoji font size, and add glow. Added `roundRect` helper.
Modified Files: main.js
GitHub Commit Summary: Improve emoji visibility (background + glow)
